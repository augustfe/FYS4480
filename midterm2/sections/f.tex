Diagram 1 in Fig.~\ref{fig:diagrams} represents a second-order contribution to the energy and a so-called $2p-2h$ contribution to the intermediate states.
Write down the expression for the wave operator in this case and compare the possible contributions with the configuration interaction calculations of exercise 3). % chktex 10 % tex-fmt: skip
