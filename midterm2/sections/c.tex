Instead of setting up all possible Slater determinants, construct only an approximation to the ground state (where we assume that the four particles are in the two lowest single-particle orbits only) which includes at most two-particle-two-hole excitations.
Diagonalize this matrix and compare with the exact calculation and comment your results.
Can you set up which diagrams this approximation corresponds to?

\subsection{}
From Fig.~\ref{fig:SDs} we see that all states except $\ket{\Phi_5}$, has states with at most one pair of electrons above the $p=2$.
Our new approximation of the ground state is then shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:c_groundstate}.

    }
\end{figure}

As the figure shows, the approximate energies are very close, regardless of whether we include the four-particle state $\ket{\Phi_5}$ or not.
