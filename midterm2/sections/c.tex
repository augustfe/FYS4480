Instead of setting up all possible Slater determinants, construct only an approximation to the ground state (where we assume that the four particles are in the two lowest single-particle orbits only) which includes at most two-particle-two-hole excitations.
Diagonalize this matrix and compare with the exact calculation and comment your results.
Can you set up which diagrams this approximation corresponds to?

\subsection{}
From Fig.~\ref{fig:SDs} we see that all states except $\ket{\Phi_5}$ have states with at most one pair of electrons above the $p=2$.
This corresponds with Configuration Interaction (CI) calculations with at most two-particle-two-hole excitations.
Our new approximation of the ground state is then shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:c_groundstate}.

As the figure shows, the approximate energies are very close, regardless of whether we include the four-particle state $\ket{\Phi_5}$.
The difference is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:c_diff_groundstate}, showing that the difference is more substantial for higher values of $g$.
As we are working with variational methods, the energy from the CI calculations will always be higher than the exact energy, as the CI calculations are based on a subset of the full space.
The contributing diagrams in this case are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2p2h}.
