Minimizing with respect to $C^*_{p\alpha}$, remembering that $C^*_{p\alpha}$ and $C_{p\alpha}$ (and that the indices contain all single-particle quantum numbers including spin) are independent and defining
\begin{equation*}
    h_{\alpha\gamma}^{HF} = \expval{\alpha}{h}{\gamma} + \sum_{p} \sum_{\beta\delta} C^*_{p\beta} C_{p\delta} \expval{\alpha\beta}{V}{\gamma\delta}_{AS},
\end{equation*}
show that you can write the Hartree-Fock equations as
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_{\gamma} h_{\alpha\gamma}^{HF} C_{p\gamma} = \epsilon_p^{\mathrm{HF}} C_{p\alpha}. \label{eq:newhf}
\end{equation*}
Explain the meaning of the different terms and define the Hartree-Fock operator in second quantization.
Write down its diagrammatic representation as well.
The greek letters refer to the wave functions in the original basis (in our case the hydrogen-like wave functions) while roman letters refer to the new basis.
