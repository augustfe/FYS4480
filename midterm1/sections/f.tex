The Hartree-Fock equations with a variation of the coefficients $C_{p\alpha}$ lead to an eigenvalue problem whose eigenvectors are the coefficients $C_{p\alpha}$ and eigenvalues are the new single-particle energies.
Use the single-particle orbits $1s{-}3s$ and set up the Hartree-Fock matrix for both the helium atom and the beryllium atom.
Find after the first diagonalization the new single-particle energies and the new ground state energy.
Compare these results with those you obtained under the minimization of the ground states as functions of $Z$ and the full diagonalization.
When setting up the Hartree-Fock matrix in the first iteration, our guess for the coefficients $C_{p\beta}$ etc.\ is $C_{p\beta}=1$ for $p=\beta$ and zero else.

\subsection{}
We set up the Hartree-Fock matrices with the code in \verb|hartree_fock.py|, for both the helium and beryllium atoms.
We index the single-particle states as $1 = 1s_+, 2 = 1s_-, \ldots, 6 = 3s_-$.

For the helium atom, we find that the new single-particle energies after the first diagonalization are
\begin{equation*}
    \varepsilon_1 = \varepsilon_2 = -0.7832 \qquad \varepsilon_3 = \varepsilon_4 = 0.0396 \qquad \varepsilon_5 = \varepsilon_6 = 0.4534,
\end{equation*}
and the new ground state energy is $-2.8292$ atomic units, which is an improvement from the value $-2.75$ atomic units we found when minimizing with respect to $Z$, but slightly worse than the result $-2.8386$ atomic units we found when fully diagonalizing the Hamiltonian.

For the beryllium atom, we find that the new single-particle energies after the first diagonalization to be
\begin{equation*}
    \varepsilon_1 = \varepsilon_2 = -3.9507 \qquad \varepsilon_3 = \varepsilon_4 = -0.1040 \qquad \varepsilon_5 = \varepsilon_6 = 0.8656,
\end{equation*}
which with a new ground state energy of $-14.4998$ atomic units is a large improvement from the estimate of $-13.7159$ we got when minimizing with respect to $Z$, and is still better than the fully diagonalized result of $-14.3621$ atomic units.

The untruncated results are available in the file \verb|hartree_fock.txt|.
