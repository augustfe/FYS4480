The Hartree-Fock equations with a variation of the coefficients $C_{p\alpha}$ lead to an eigenvalue problem whose eigenvectors are the coefficients $C_{p\alpha}$ and eigenvalues are the new single-particle energies.
Use the single-particle orbits $1s{-}3s$ and set up the Hartree-Fock matrix for both the helium atom and the beryllium atom.
Find after the first diagonalization the new single-particle energies and the new ground state energy.
Compare these results with those you obtained under the minimization of the ground states as functions of $Z$ and the full diagonalization.
When setting up the Hartree-Fock matrix in the first iteration, our guess for the coefficients $C_{p\beta}$ etc.\ is $C_{p\beta}=1$ for $p=\beta$ and zero else.
