Define the Hamiltonian in a second-quantized form and use this to compute the expectation value of the ground state (defining the so-called reference energy and later our Hartree-Fock functional) of
the helium atom.
Show that it is given by
\begin{equation}
    E[\Phi_0] = \expval{c}{\hat{H}}{c} = \sum_{i} \expval{i}{\hat{h}_0}{i} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}\left[\expval*{ij}{\tfrac{1}{r}}{ij} - \expval*{ij}{\tfrac{1}{r}}{ji}\right].
\end{equation}
Define properly the sums keeping in mind that the states $ij$ refer to all quantum numbers $n, l, m_l, s, m_s$.
Use the values for the various matrix elements listed at the end of the midterm to find the value of $E$ as function of $Z$ and compute $E$ as function of $Z$.
